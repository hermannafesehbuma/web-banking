# ✅ Card Creation Email - FINAL FIX APPLIED!

## 🐛 **Two Issues Found & Resolved**

### **Issue #1: Missing Address Column**

**Error:** `column bank_users.address does not exist`  
**Fix:** ✅ Now fetching address from `kyc_submissions` table instead

### **Issue #2: Undefined Environment Variable**

**Error:** `Failed to parse URL from undefined/api/emails/card-request`  
**Root Cause:** `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` was not set in `.env` file  
**Fix:** ✅ Added fallback to `http://localhost:3000` for development

## 🔧 **Final Code Changes**

### **Updated `/api/cards/route.ts`:**

```typescript
// 1. Fetch user data from bank_users (email, full_name)
const { data: userData } = await supabase
  .from('bank_users')
  .select('email, full_name') // ✅ No 'address' here
  .eq('id', user.id)
  .single();

// 2. Fetch address from kyc_submissions separately
const { data: kycData } = await supabase
  .from('kyc_submissions')
  .select('address')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .order('submitted_at', { ascending: false })
  .limit(1)
  .single();

const deliveryAddress = kycData?.address || 'Your registered address';

// 3. Use fallback URL for development
const baseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';

// 4. Send email with correct data
const emailResponse = await fetch(`${baseUrl}/api/emails/card-request`, {
  /* ... */
});
```

## ✅ **What's Fixed Now**

1. ✅ **Correct database queries** - Fetching from the right tables
2. ✅ **URL handling** - Works even without environment variable
3. ✅ **Comprehensive logging** - Easy to debug any future issues
4. ✅ **Fallback values** - Graceful handling of missing data

## 🎯 **Expected Console Output (Success)**
