# ✅ Card Creation Email - FIXED!

## 🐛 **Problem Identified & Resolved**

### **Error Found:**

```
❌ Error fetching user data: {
  code: '42703',
  message: 'column bank_users.address does not exist'
}
```

### **Root Cause:**

The code was trying to fetch `address` from `bank_users` table, but in your database schema, `address` is stored in the `kyc_submissions` table, not `bank_users`.

**bank_users columns:**

- `id`, `email`, `full_name`, `kyc_status`, `created_at`

**kyc_submissions columns:**

- `id`, `user_id`, `address`, `phone_number`, etc.

### **✅ Solution Applied:**

Updated `/api/cards/route.ts` to:

1. **Fetch user data from `bank_users`:**

   ```typescript
   const { data: userData } = await supabase
     .from('bank_users')
     .select('email, full_name') // ✅ Removed 'address'
     .eq('id', user.id)
     .single();
   ```

2. **Fetch address from `kyc_submissions`:**

   ```typescript
   const { data: kycData } = await supabase
     .from('kyc_submissions')
     .select('address')
     .eq('user_id', user.id)
     .order('submitted_at', { ascending: false })
     .limit(1)
     .single();

   const deliveryAddress = kycData?.address || 'Your registered address';
   ```

3. **Use both together for the email:**
   ```typescript
   const emailPayload = {
     email: userData.email,
     userName: userData.full_name,
     cardType: card_type,
     deliveryAddress: deliveryAddress, // ✅ From kyc_submissions
   };
   ```
