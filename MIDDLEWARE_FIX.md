# 🔧 Middleware Session Detection Fix

## Issue

Middleware keeps redirecting to login even after successful login.

## Root Cause

The session is not being properly synced between client and server/middleware.

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Updated Supabase Client (`src/lib/SupbaseClient.tsx`)

- Changed from `createClient` → `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr`
- This ensures session is stored in cookies (not just localStorage)
- Cookies are readable by middleware

### 2. Updated Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)

- Properly implements `@supabase/ssr` cookie handlers
- Uses `getUser()` instead of `getSession()` for better reliability
- Added debug logging (temporary - remove in production)

### 3. Updated Callback Route (`src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`)

- Fixed cookie handler implementation
- Added error handling

---

## 🧪 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check if cookies are being set after login

1. **Login** at `/auth/login`
2. **Open DevTools** → Application → Cookies → `http://localhost:3000`
3. **Look for** cookies like:
   - `sb-<project-ref>-auth-token`
   - `sb-<project-ref>-auth-token-code-verifier`
   - Or similar Supabase auth cookies

**If cookies are missing:**

- The client isn't persisting the session
- Check Supabase project settings

### Step 2: Check middleware logs

1. **After login**, try to visit `/dashboard`
2. **Check terminal** (where `npm run dev` is running)
3. **Look for** middleware logs like:
   ```
   [Middleware] {
     pathname: '/dashboard',
     hasUser: true,
     userId: 'abc-123...',
     cookies: ['sb-...', '...']
   }
   ```

**If `hasUser: false`:**

- Cookies aren't being read by middleware
- Or session format is wrong

### Step 3: Use debug page

1. **After login**, visit `/debug/auth`
2. **Check**:
   - Has Session: Should be ✅ Yes
   - Has User: Should be ✅ Yes
   - Cookies: Should show Supabase auth cookies

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Restart Dev Server

Sometimes cookie changes require a fresh server restart:

```bash
# Kill dev server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### Fix 2: Clear Browser Cache & Cookies

1. DevTools → Application → Clear storage
2. Reload page
3. Login again
4. Check if cookies are set this time

### Fix 3: Check Supabase Auth Settings

**In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings:**

1. **Site URL**: Should be `http://localhost:3000` (for dev)
2. **Redirect URLs**: Add these:
   - `http://localhost:3000/**` (wildcard)
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
3. **Email Confirmations**: Can be disabled for testing (enable in prod)

### Fix 4: Use Correct Cookie Domain

If you're testing on a different domain (not localhost), ensure:

- Supabase auth is configured for your domain
- Cookies aren't being blocked by SameSite rules

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Successful Login Flow:

1. User logs in at `/auth/login`
2. **Supabase sets auth cookies** in browser
3. **Login page checks KYC** and redirects:
   - KYC pending → `/kyc`
   - KYC approved → `/dashboard`
4. User lands on correct page
5. **Middleware sees session** and allows access
6. No more redirect loops!

### Accessing Protected Routes:

1. User visits `/dashboard` directly (URL bar)
2. **Middleware checks cookies**
3. **Finds valid session** → Allows access
4. Page loads normally

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Cookies not set after login

**Cause**: Client not using `createBrowserClient`
**Fix**: Already updated in `src/lib/SupbaseClient.tsx`

### Issue: Middleware doesn't see cookies

**Cause**: Cookie handlers not properly implemented
**Fix**: Already updated in `src/middleware.ts`

### Issue: CORS or SameSite blocking cookies

**Cause**: Browser security blocking cross-site cookies
**Fix**: Ensure Site URL in Supabase matches your dev URL exactly

### Issue: Redirect loop

**Cause**: Middleware matches too many paths or session not persisting
**Fix**: Check matcher pattern and cookie persistence

## 🚀 Test Checklist

After the fixes, test this flow:

- [ ] Login at `/auth/login`
- [ ] Check DevTools → Cookies (should see Supabase auth cookies)
- [ ] Visit `/debug/auth` (should show session + user)
- [ ] Terminal shows middleware logs with `hasUser: true`
- [ ] Visit `/dashboard` directly (should NOT redirect)
- [ ] Visit `/kyc` directly (should NOT redirect if email verified)
- [ ] Logout, then try `/dashboard` (SHOULD redirect to login)

---

## 💡 If Still Not Working

1. **Share terminal middleware logs** - paste what you see when accessing `/dashboard`
2. **Share browser cookies** - screenshot of cookies in DevTools
3. **Share `/debug/auth` output** - what does it show?

With this info, I can pinpoint the exact issue!
