# Remaining Email Templates to Update

Due to the large file size, I've completed styling for the following templates:

## âœ… Completed:

1. Welcome Email
2. KYC Submitted
3. KYC Approved
4. KYC Rejected
5. Card Request
6. Money Transfer Confirmation
7. Bill Payment Confirmation
8. Refund Created (User) - JUST UPDATED

## ðŸ”„ Still Need Professional Styling:

9. Refund Status Update
10. Refund Created Admin
11. Refund Approved
12. KYC Submitted Admin

These templates exist in the file but still have the old simple black and white styling. They need to be updated with:

- Professional header with "FORTIZ BANK"
- "Dear [Name]," greeting
- Detailed content descriptions
- Professional footer with contact info
- Proper domain links (https://www.fortizb.com/...)
- Mature corporate design

## Next Steps:

I need to update the remaining 4 templates in `/src/lib/email.ts`:

- `refundStatusUpdate` (line ~572)
- `refundCreatedAdmin` (line ~551 in old version)
- `refundApproved` (line ~598 in old version)
- `kycSubmittedAdmin` (line ~679 in old version)

Shall I continue updating these remaining templates?
