# 🔄 Restart Development Server

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Your changes are not being applied!

The console logs show that the `updateStatus` function is **NOT** being called, even though we added extensive logging to it.

This means the Next.js development server has not picked up the file changes.

## 🔧 Solution: Restart the Development Server

### **Option 1: Hard Refresh (Try this first)**

1. In your browser, press `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
2. This will force reload the page with a fresh cache
3. Try approving a KYC submission again

### **Option 2: Restart Next.js Dev Server**

1. **Stop the server**: In your terminal where Next.js is running, press `Ctrl + C`
2. **Clear Next.js cache** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   ```
3. **Start the server again**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Wait for compilation** to complete
5. **Refresh your browser** and try again

### **Option 3: Clear All Caches**

If the above doesn't work:

1. **Stop the dev server** (`Ctrl + C`)
2. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache
   ```
3. **Restart**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Hard refresh browser** (`Cmd + Shift + R`)

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

After restarting, when you click "Approve", you should see:

```
🖱️ APPROVE BUTTON CLICKED!
🖱️ Submission ID: ...
🖱️ Calling updateStatus function...
🚀 ===== UPDATE STATUS FUNCTION CALLED =====
📧 Updating KYC status to approved for submission ...
🚀 ===== FUNCTION START =====
🔄 ========== UPDATING KYC SUBMISSION STATUS ==========
📝 Submission ID to update: ...
📝 ID type: string
📝 New status to set: approved
📝 Status type: string
```

## 📊 Current Issue

**What you're seeing**: Only email-related logs
**What you should see**: Button click → Function call → Status update → Account creation → Email

The fact that you only see email logs means the code execution is somehow skipping the entire `updateStatus` function, which should be impossible unless the old code is still cached.

## ✅ After Restart

Once restarted, all the enhanced logging will work and we'll see exactly what's happening with the KYC status update and account creation! 🎉
