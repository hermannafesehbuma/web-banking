        <h2>1. Eligibility and account registration</h2>
        <p>
          You represent that you are of legal age to form a binding contract and

        <h2>2. Account security</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          credentials and restricting access to your devices. Notify us
          immediately of any suspected unauthorized activity. Fortiz is not
          responsible for losses arising from compromised credentials where you
          failed to implement reasonable safeguards.

        <h2>5. Transactions and limitations</h2>
        <p>
          Certain transaction limits and holds may apply to protect account
          security and comply with regulations. We may decline or reverse any
          transaction that appears fraudulent, violates these Terms, or is not
          permitted by law.

        <h2>6. Compliance and verification</h2>
        <p>

          AVAILABLE&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
          INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND
