# Transaction Creation Test

## ✅ **Database Status: FIXED**

The RLS policies are correctly configured:

- ✅ `transactions_insert_owner` - Users can insert their own transactions
- ✅ `transactions_select_owner` - Users can view their own transactions
- ✅ `transactions_update_owner` - Users can update their own transactions
- ✅ Admin policies for delete/update are also in place

## 🧪 **Test Transaction Creation**

### **Test 1: Bill Payment**

1. Go to Dashboard → Bills
2. Fill out a bill payment form
3. Submit the payment
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Check Supabase Table Editor → `transactions` table for new record

**Expected Result:**

- No console errors
- New transaction record with:
  - `transaction_type: 'bill_payment'`
  - `direction: 'debit'`
  - `status: 'completed'`
  - `currency: 'USD'`

### **Test 2: Send Money**

1. Go to Dashboard → Send Money
2. Fill out external transfer form
3. Submit the transfer
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Check Supabase Table Editor → `transactions` table for new record

**Expected Result:**

- No console errors
- New transaction record with:
  - `transaction_type: 'external_transfer'`
  - `direction: 'debit'`
  - `status: 'completed'`
  - `currency: 'USD'`

### **Test 3: Internal Transfer**

1. Go to Dashboard → Transfer
2. Transfer between checking/savings accounts
3. Submit the transfer
4. Check browser console for any errors
5. Check Supabase Table Editor → `transactions` table for TWO new records

**Expected Result:**

- No console errors
- TWO transaction records:
  - Debit from source account
  - Credit to destination account
  - Both with `transaction_type: 'internal_transfer'`

## 🔍 **Debugging Steps**

If transactions are still not being created:

### **1. Check Console Errors**

Look for any error messages in browser console when submitting payments/transfers.

### **2. Check Network Tab**

- Open browser DevTools → Network tab
- Submit a payment/transfer
- Look for any failed API calls (red status codes)

### **3. Check Supabase Logs**

- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Logs
- Look for any RLS policy violations or database errors

### **4. Verify User Authentication**

Make sure the user is properly authenticated:

```javascript
// Check in browser console
const {
  data: { user },
} = await supabase.auth.getUser();
console.log('Current user:', user);
```

## 📊 **Expected Transaction Schema**

After successful creation, transactions should have:

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "user_id": "user-uuid",
  "account_id": "account-uuid",
  "transaction_type": "bill_payment|external_transfer|internal_transfer|refund",
  "direction": "debit|credit",
  "amount": 100.0,
  "currency": "USD",
  "status": "completed|pending",
  "description": "Bill payment to ABC Company",
  "reference": "BILL-1234567890",
  "balance_after": 500.0,
  "metadata": {
    "payee_name": "ABC Company",
    "payee_category": "utilities"
  },
  "created_at": "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

✅ **Transactions are being created** when:

- Paying bills
- Sending money externally
- Making internal transfers
- Processing refunds

✅ **No console errors** during transaction creation

✅ **All required fields** are populated in the database

✅ **Transaction history** displays the new records

If all tests pass, the transaction system is working correctly! 🎉
